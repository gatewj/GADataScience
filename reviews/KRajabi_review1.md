Your project 1 was a great start.  You had explain the data well and is very interesting.  You went through the exploratory data analysis by using the describe function and showing a few plots.  Also, I valued how you incorporated your understanding of each of the subsets by stating your observations.  Your bar graphs were done very nicely and I was able to follow the results clearly.  Your code was also easily accessible.  Just on the worksheet itself, please provide a discussion about the data and what you are exploring and what you would like to understand from the data.   Good job with the initial questions however.  Other than that I thought this was a great start.
