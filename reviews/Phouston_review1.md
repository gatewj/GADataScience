Good job describing how you collected the data and outlining the purpose of your project.  Good job doing the exploratory data analysis by using the describe function and exploring using plots.  The scatter matrix was readable but the other plots were a little confusing.  Also, you code for the most part was readable, Im still confused on the time series stuff, but I was able to follow somewhat what you did.  Can you also explain in a little more detail what you mean by the most volatile tickets.  Not very clear to me.  Great first start.
