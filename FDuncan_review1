Good beginning.  First, I liked how you provided some background about the data.  Also, going through the exploratory data analysis was done well by using the describe function, cleaning up the data columns and showing some graphs.  Your code was clear and easy to follow, however, the zoom in and out for latitude and longitude was not very clear.  But, very good job introducing the group to the latitude and longitude functions.  Your plots were clear with good titles just make sure to include what the x and the y axis stand for.  I would also like to see a little more discussion on why you choose your limits and maybe explore if the program already has some set limits.  Good job describing some of the early observations of the data by asking some questions based on your observations.  You are on the right track and asking the right questions.  Good job.
